This is a randomly generated world simulation.  It has machines that make
energy bolts but also emit smog, and some other natural and peculiar things.

To build, read the instructions I wrote in the beginning of "compile.sh".
I've only used it on Linux myself; if you're lucky it might work on another
system too.

To run,
./build/game

To run the simulation faster, run
./build/game -s 100
where 500 is the default value and lower is faster.
